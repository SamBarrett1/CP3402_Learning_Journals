# CP3402 Content Manangement Systems
## Weekly Learning Journals

By Sam Barrett

## Week: 2

## Learning Activities & Resources:
- I read over some fo the Joomla documentation https://docs.joomla.org/J4.x:Getting_Started_with_Joomla!
- I watched some of the Joomla website tutorials. These were outdated to version 3.0 so I found version 5 tutorials on youtube.
- Basic Joomla version 5 tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkaEcCTyuH4
- I watched the Cloudaccess . net tutorials to get started with free hosting: https://www.cloudaccess.net/joomla-knowledgebase/138-joomla-3-1/getting-started/771-tutorial-1-launching-a-demo-instance-joomla-3-2.html

## Estimated Hours: 12
- Including watching lectures. The online seminar and researching how to build and host a free Joomla site, I had easily spent 12hours work.

## Content Insights:
- I spent about 4 hours just looking over the suggested startup links:
- https://www.cloudways.com/blog/best-startups-watch-out/
- https://angel.co/job-collections/52-best-startup-companies-to-watch-out-for-in-2020
- I set up a free website on a free Cloudaccess server. 

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
- I could not think of any ideas or good domain names that had not been taken. I could not waste any more time and just created a random name called 'WhateverStartup' to use for this prac and my Assignment 1. I don't think it is fair to expect a startup idea and would prefer to have been given a list of startup ideas to choose from. If I was working as a web designer I would not be required to create a new startup.
- From what I have learnt so far I am starting to see what it takes to be a CMS based web designer and how you could use a Trello based workflow to manage clients.
