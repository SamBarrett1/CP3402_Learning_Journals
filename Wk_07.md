## Estimated Hours: 10


## Content Insights:
- I learnt more about how WordPress saves pages, posts and images in the database and this must be synced with the staging server for remote
working teams to see the same content. Options for dealing with this were covered in a sitepoint article linked below.
- It is important to make sure that all the teams members are working with the same syncronised database for WordPress development. This needs to be
safely transferred between local and staging servers and ensured it is not sent to the live production site during development.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
- A good workflow for WordPress development is important for reducing manual data transfers and increasing productivity.
- The plug-ins and available repositories for creating an effecient WordPress team workflow with version control are always changing and requires
research from time to time. Understanding these things and setting up a good workflow is a sought after skill.
