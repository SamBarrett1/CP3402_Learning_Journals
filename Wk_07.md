# CP3402 Content Management Systems
## Weekly Learning Journals

By Sam Barrett

## Week: 7

## Learning Activities & Resources:
- This week I looked into WordPress workflows. I looked at Docker containers for Wordpress local development.
- And I looked further into VVV boxes for local development with remote git version control and set one up on my system.
- I refreshed git again with a youtube video.
- I completed the Prac 7 requirements in PHP with adviceshop cloned from a fork in my Github repository. I could not get adviceshop to run in
VVV box, or the WAMP server. So I ran adviceshop in PHPStorm and practiced in a file called quick.php.
- I later watched some more scotchbox videos and decided to try clone it and see if the older versions of things really mattered. I opened VirtualBox and then ran vagrant up from the terminal and saw it start up a machine. So I managed to get a ScotchBox running, added the adviceshop files to the public folder and replaced the index.php. I could then open that scotchbox project in PHPStorm and see how the php works with the SQLite database with the $dbh variable as a PDO object.
- I read through parts of the PHP manual online.

## Estimated Hours: 10

## Content Insights:
- I learnt more about how WordPress saves pages, posts and images in the database and this must be synced with the staging server for remote
working teams to see the same content. Options for dealing with this were covered in a sitepoint article linked below.
- It is important to make sure that all the teams members are working with the same syncronised database for WordPress development. This needs to be
safely transferred between local and staging servers and ensured it is not sent to the live production site during development.
- The PHP language feels similar to C++ to me. It has a large online community and good documentation available for accessing information. I would
benefit from a Udemy course or something similar where I built a basic website from scratch with PHP, a few different servers and no WordPress software.
- I now understand how specific Vagrantfiles can be added to new projects and create standardised virtual boxes for teams to work with.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
- A good workflow for WordPress development is important for reducing manual data transfers and increasing productivity.
- The plug-ins and available repositories for creating an effecient WordPress team workflow with version control are always changing and requires
research from time to time. Understanding these things and setting up a good workflow is a sought after skill.
- The basic PHP skills I have now can be easily built upon if I was employed in web design. Once in a field I am very capable of becoming a productive
and efficient employee.
