# CP3402 Content Management Systems
## Weekly Learning Journals

By Sam Barrett

## Week: 6

## Learning Activities & Resources:
- This week I looked into WordPress workflows. I looked at Docker containers for Wordpress local development.
- And I looked further into VVV boxes for local development with remote git version control and set one up on my system.
- I refreshed git again with a youtube video.
- I completed the Prac 7 requirements in PHP with adviceshop cloned from a fork in my Github repository. I could not get adviceshop to run in
VVV box, or the WAMP server and ScotchBox is years old so I didn't try it. So I ran adviceshop in PHPStorm and practiced in a file called quick.php.
- I could not connect to the adviceshop database in PHPStorm.
- Single line PHP comments // are still showing up in browser output? And within the PHPStorm console when code is run.
- I would now do a Udemy course in PHP programming, Project Management and PHPStorm lessons if I had a few weeks more time to clarify these matters.
- I read through parts of the PHP manual online.

## Estimated Hours: 10

## Content Insights:
- I learnt more about how WordPress saves pages, posts and images in the database and this must be synced with the staging server for remote
working teams to see the same content. Options for dealing with this were covered in a sitepoint article linked below.
- It is important to make sure that all the teams members are working with the same syncronised database for WordPress development. This needs to be
safely transferred between local and staging servers and ensured it is not sent to the live production site during development.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
- A good workflow for WordPress development is important for reducing manual data transfers and increasing productivity.
- The plug-ins and available repositories for creating an effecient WordPress team workflow with version control are always changing and requires
research from time to time. Understanding these things and setting up a good workflow is a sought after skill.
