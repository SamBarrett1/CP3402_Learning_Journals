## Week: 4

## Learning Activities & Resources:

__Vagrant is a script like software with a main Vagrant file that standardises and automates VM deployment. It works with free VM software _VirtualBox_ by Oracle__
- VirtualBox was downloaded from https://www.virtualbox.org/
- Downloaded Vagrant from: https://www.vagrantup.com/
- Verified the Vagrant download SHA256 with Windows built in cerutil: certutil -hashfile C:\Users\<User_Name_In_Path_Here>\Downloads\<software_File_Here.zip> SHA256 
- Had issues checking that Hashicorp had signed the SHA256 checksums with their PGP key as I was having trouble with Kleopatra, still checked Windows download said it was from Hashicorp before continuing install
- VVV Vagrant Repo: https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV
- Wordmove, like an FTP for pushing and pulling WP sites: https://github.com/welaika/wordmove

\
__What is Scotch Box?__
- It is a LAMP stack on a VM with all the software for developing software or a Worpress site installed, this is all written into a Vagrant file script, good for developing locally, could be installed on a VPS I suppose
- Vagrant and Scotch Box what they are and how to run a full setup tutorials from Digital Ocean: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpQNCsiVyWU&list=PLseEp7p6EwiYIMokXK9WvHo2ILgeXF_eq&index=11

\
__Wordpress workflow example with Github__
- Another interesting video I watched that also includes using Trello as a type of team job ticketing system: How to use a Wordpress Development Workflow with Github: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzs-X2z-96Y

## Content Insights:
Worpress Workflows:
- Using local host software like XAMP, WAMP, AMPPS can result in case sensitive name conflicts (Index.php (permittable on Windows WAMP) vs index.php (standard linux lowercase file naming rules etc.)) when deploying to Production sites on Linux based servers, so it is better to create a local environment that will be compatibile across devices with a vagrant file and VM
- Teams can then all receive the same Vagrant file and know they are working in the same local environment
- Teams can then use software like Wordmove to push and pull changes to/from the staging server, then once everyone is satisfied with the staging site it can be pushed to the production server

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
- After this week's content on WP Workflows, I can see how a team of developers can work together and how this is the way some software and web design companies effectively run the development of their projects by segregating their local, staging and production environments with GitHub version control
