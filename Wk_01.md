# CP3402 Content Manangement Systems
## Weekly Learning Journals

By Sam Barrett

## Week: 1

## Learning Activities & Resources:
- This week I have read over my notes from the year 1 web design subject, this took up a lot of the 12hours.
- I practiced some HTML, CSS and JS with VSCode and pushed the practical work to a public Github repository.
- I looked at how PHP is used with a basic user input form
- I looked into some online video tutorials to see various web dev environment setups:
- Intro to Vagrant: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czMCO1w-xQU&list=PLhW3qG5bs-L9S272lwi9encQOL9nMOnRa&index=1
- Docker Wordpress Dev environment example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIqWxjDj4IU
- Lando Wordpress dev environment example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYXBHoNwAuU

## Estimated Hours: 12

## Content Insights:
- I like the way Vagrant standardises the deployment of virtual machines, to keep them the same. I see how Docker can do this in lighter way without a hypervisor.
- Docker just uses containers, whereas Vagrant works with a Virtual Machine created with software like Oracle's VirtualBox, or VMware, a Virtual Machine a container that has a full OS like Ubuntu or Windows running within them.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
- I can see how this subject can assist in web design as it looks to cover full-stack web development, with and without a CMS.
