## Weekly Learning Journals

By Sam Barrett

## Week: 1

## Learning Activities & Resources:
- This week I have read over my notes from the year 1 web design subject, this took up a lot of the 12hours.
- I practiced some HTML, CSS and JS with VSCode and pushed the practical work to a public Github repository.
- I looked at how PHP is used with a basic user input form
- I watched some of the LinkedIn learning videos: https://www.linkedin.com/learning/introduction-to-web-design-and-development-14628245
- I looked into some online video tutorials to see various web dev environment setups:
- Intro to Vagrant: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czMCO1w-xQU&list=PLhW3qG5bs-L9S272lwi9encQOL9nMOnRa&index=1
- Docker Wordpress Dev environment (Locally) example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIqWxjDj4IU
- How to move a locally set-up Docker environment to the cloud as per Wk1 resources: https://www.docker.com/blog/deploying-wordpress-to-the-cloud/
- Lando Wordpress Dev environment example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYXBHoNwAuU

## Estimated Hours: 12

## Content Insights:
- I like the way Vagrant standardises the deployment of virtual machines, to keep them the same. I see how Docker does this in lighter way without a virtual machine.
- Docker just uses containers, whereas Vagrant works with a Virtual Machine created with software like Oracle's VirtualBox, or VMware, a Virtual Machine a container that has a full OS like Ubuntu or Windows running within them.
- I will look into how to get a GitHub repository into a Web Dev environment with a web hook as suggested by the lecturer. This way a team can work on the repository and this can be previewed in a container.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
- I can see how this subject will assist in web design as it looks to cover full-stack web development, with and without a CMS.
