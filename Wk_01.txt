Week: 1
Learning Activities & Resources:
- This week I have read over my notes from the year 1 web design subject. I practiced with VSCode and pushed the practical work to a public Github repository.
- I looked into Vagrant with the HashiCorp website and watched some online video tutorials to see it in use. 

Estimated Hours: 12

Content Insights:
- I like the way Vagrant standardises the deployment of virtual machines, to keep them the same. I see how Docker can do this in lighter way without a hypervisor.

Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
- I can see how this subject can assist in web design as it looks to cover full-stack web development, with and without a CMS.
