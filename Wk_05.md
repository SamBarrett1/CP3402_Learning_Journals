- Downloaded WP Theme 2017, 2019, 2020 and extracted them into the WP themes folder in the WAMP server files
> [!IMPORTANT]
> I always verify the SHA256 Checksum of the downloads (and verify the signers in most cases with their PGP) with:\
> `certutil -hashfile C:\Users\user1\Downloads\software.zip SHA256`\
> Windows built-in Certutil supports either:\
> `MD2, MD4, MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA384` and `SHA512`\
> (Change the end of the command to hash sum of choice)
