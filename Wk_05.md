# CP3402 Content Manangement Systems
## Weekly Learning Journals

By Sam Barrett

## Week: 5

## Learning Activities & Resources:
- Built the local environment for 'Local' WordPress development on a Windows 10 machine so I could create a child-theme and start experimenting with additional CSS modifications
- Refreshed WAMP server that was downloaded from: https://www.wampserver.com/en/
- NOTE: If you can't login to MyPHPadmin of the WAMP in localhost, you probably have MySQL Workbench already installed and it is needing it's password, when logging into MyPHPadmin from WAMP in localhost/ it will need username as set in config.inc.php in MyPHPadmin of wamp files, but using the password you set for MySQL Workbench
- This will also mean you need to include this MySQL Workbench password into the Database password section of the wp-config.php file in the wordpress directory of your WAMP files in order to login to your WAMP localhost's virtualhost wordpress
- Downloaded Worpress (WP) and installed it into the WAMP server
- Downloaded WP Theme 2017, 2019, 2020 and extracted them into the WP themes folder in the WAMP server files
- Downloaded JetBrains PhpStorm IDE to test drive: https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/
> [!IMPORTANT]
> I always verify the SHA256 Checksum of the downloads (and verify the signers in most cases with their PGP) with:\
> `certutil -hashfile C:\Users\user1\Downloads\software.zip SHA256`\
> Windows built-in Certutil supports either:\
> `MD2, MD4, MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA384` and `SHA512`\
> (Change the end of the command to hash sum of choice)\
> For Linux and MacOS see: https://techdocs.akamai.com/download-ctr/docs/verify-checksum
> Looked at the local host website with 3 browser inspectors: Chrome, Firefox and Brave

## Estimated Hours: 10

## Content Insights:
- It is good to see that you can modify parts of a child theme and be safe from losing those changes when the theme gets updated
- It was interesting to see the coding standards that Wordpress recommends for CSS: https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/css/
- Writing a fictional LinkedIn profile skills section was good practice

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
- It is a good skill to understand how child-themes work. By building a client's chosen theme as a child-theme to begin with, you could make changes that are not over written by theme updates
- Being familiar with web services like LinkedIn profiles is one way to publically display your resume for potential employers if you were looking for employment
