# CP3402 Content Management Systems
## Weekly Learning Journals

By Sam Barrett  

## Week: 10  

## Learning Activities & Resources:  
- My team and I completed our assignment this week. We built a custom WordPress theme for a client. [I forked a copy of this into my GitHub account](https://github.com/SamBarrett1/project-2025-tr1-jcua-team6) for future reference.
- This week I have looked into the security of CMSs. This included what is involved in web development security and the vulnerabilities unique to this area of technology.
- For further information on industry website backup and restoration I looked into the [WordPress standards for backing up and restoring websites.](https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/security/backup/)
- I looked at the [official WordPress documentation for generating public private key pairs.](https://developer.wordpress.com/docs/developer-tools/ssh/) This guide includes instructions using Putty for Windows 10 and 11 systems.


## Estimated Hours: 4  
- Approximately 10 additional hours was spent on the group assignment.  

## Content Insights:  
- WordPress plug-ins and themes are the surfaces for a large majority of security breaches. Only install plug-ins from trusted sources like [the WordPress plug-ins page.](https://wordpress.org/plugins/) Or from [trusted theme websites such as Template Mosnster.](https://www.templatemonster.com/wordpress-themes.php)
- There are WordPress plug-ins available that analyse and recommend security upgrades that can be made to all aspects of a WordPress website. These cover passwords, SSH keys, keys for site cookies, file permissions, 2FA, adding captures and highlighting other various easily missed areas of significance.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
- One of [the most sought after skills in the Australian I.T. industry in 2024](https://www.arnnet.com.au/article/1307175/ai-cyber-security-skills-top-priority-among-aussie-it-employers-in-2024.html) next to AI, data analysis and software development were cyber security skills.
- I read an interesting [article about the imapct of AI search suggestions on website traffic in late 2024.](https://www.zerohedge.com/technology/betrayed-thats-word-small-business-owners-reel-google-ai-destroys-google-search) This will be something to consider for any future web development SEO skills. New website monetisation strategies and business models will need to be found. I believe skills and ideas in this new frontier will be highly sought after by employers.
