# CP3402 Content Management Systems
## Weekly Learning Journals

By Sam Barrett

## Week: 9

## Learning Activities & Resources:
- This week I studied [Sass for CSS.](https://sass-lang.com/) It is a CSS extension language.
- I followed along with a tutorial that created a mainstyles.scss file copy of a mainstyles.css file and created a SCSS file watcher in Phpstorm. I opened the index.php file with the built-in-preview in Phpstorm to see the changes made to the mainstyles.scss file update the live website.

## Estimated Hours: 4

## Content Insights:
- Changes made to the .sass file automatically converts the .css file when using a Phpstorm SCSS file watcher.
- You can also link changes made to the mainstyles.scss file to the maintsyles.css file with [a javascript task runner known as Grunt.](https://ryanchristiani.com/getting-started-with-grunt-and-sass/)
- You can create dryer code by nesting elements within curly braces.
