## Weekly Learning Journals

By Sam Barrett

## Week: 9

## Learning Activities & Resources:
- This week I studied [Sass for CSS.](https://sass-lang.com/) It is a CSS extension language, a CSS preprocessor that is becoming very popular amongst experienced web developers as of 2025.
- I followed along with a university tutorial that created a mainstyles.scss file copy of a mainstyles.css file and created a SCSS file watcher in Phpstorm. I opened the index.php file with the built-in-preview in Phpstorm to see the changes made to the mainstyles.scss file update the live website in real time.
- I used [a web application that lightens colors for web development.](https://mdigi.tools/lighten-color/#1fa889)
- I read an interesting article about [the top 5 WordPress migration plug-ins in 2022.](https://www.inmotionhosting.com/blog/wordpress-staging-plugins/#:~:text=All%2Din%2DOne%20WP%20Migration%20is%20mainly%20a%20plugin,addon%20domain%2C%20where%20WordPress%20is%20already%20installed.)
- Watched a video on [how to migrate a WordPress website from a local host to a remote server](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_HeL-fKXho), which could be a production server. Migrating manually with a file was demonstrated. I downloaded the extension to see the field for a migration to DigitalOcean, it was pay-walled and did not specify if it was one click.
- Looked into [UpDraft Migrate, a migration plug-in for WordPress.](https://teamupdraft.com/updraftplus/wordpress-migration-plugin/) It looks like a great product for a business needing to regularly migrate sites from staging to production servers for an annual fee.

## Estimated Hours: 4
- Additonal 12+ hours work on a group assignment.

## Content Insights:
- Changes made to the mainstyles.sass file automatically converts the mainstyles.css file when using a Phpstorm SCSS file watcher.
- You can also link changes made to the mainstyles.scss file to the maintsyles.css file with [a javascript task runner known as Grunt.](https://ryanchristiani.com/getting-started-with-grunt-and-sass/)
- By using Sass, a developer can create dryer code by nesting otherwise repetitively named elements within curly braces under one main element name and still have the same CSS effects translated from the SCSS file.
- [Sass offers functions, nesting, mixins, variables, partials and modules.](https://sass-lang.com/guide/)  

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
- Having experience with Sass is a sign of a broad foundation in web development. Althouth [native CSS is enabling nesting and variables](https://medium.com/@erennaktas/is-css-the-new-sass-heres-what-you-need-to-know-in-2025-fef0e9a379c6), Sass is always evolving.
