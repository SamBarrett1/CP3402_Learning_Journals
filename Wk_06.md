## Estimated Hours: 5
- Including an additional 6 hours work finalising the Startup Assignment 1 and handing it in.

## Content Insights:
- I am gaining some interesting insights into how teams of WordPress developers create an integrated workflow for their
development.
- I have read of some logical version control startegies where team members work on their own separate branch and then create
pull requests up to a staging branch. From there once the team is happy they merge that branch with the production branch which
is then automatically deployed live from their production server.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
- Having a good understanding of Github Version Control looks to be an important skill to have if you want to work in the industry.
- A good understanding of different hosting options and how to set them up, such as having some AWS experience with EC2 or Lightsail
is a sought after skill by employers.
