By Sam Barrett

## Week: 8

## Learning Activities & Resources:
- Watching video on [how to create individual branches from VSCode.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?
- Created a branch of the 'Learning Activities & Resources' part of this weeks learning journal
- 

## Estimated Hours: 3

## Learning Experiment 
- This week I will experiment on my learning by using the [Pomodoro technique](https://www.todoist.com/productivity-methods/pomodoro-technique) 

**Hypothesis:** I can accomplish more work in a shorter amount of time by using the Pomodoro technique.  
- First 25mins: I further studied version control watching videos on [how to create individual branches from VSCode.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dedz4gRHezg&t=193s)
- Second 25mins: I then looked into pull requests and how to merge these branches into the master branch.
- Third 25mins: I now created a feature branch for the Learning Activities & Resources part of this weeks learning journal to test what I have learned
- Fourth 25mins:
  
**Results:**  
- After analising more productivity I believe I have accomplished more in a shorter period of time.
- I can confirm my hypothesis is correct and the work experiment has been a success.
  
**Conclusion:**  
- Looking back over this work experimet I believe the Pomodoro technique does effectively enhance productivity by
breaking down complex tasks into smaller pieces and increasing concentration and focus by incorporating 5minute breaks every 25mins with
the 4th break being 15-30minutes. I often spend alot of hours working on a subject that is made up of times that could be procrastination, or 
distraction due to not enough breaks. Splitting up the work with these 5 minute breaks and dedicating yourself to 25minutes of productivity is 
very effective at increasing the amount of work you can do in a shorter period of time.
