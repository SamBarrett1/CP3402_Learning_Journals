## Weekly Learning Journals

By Sam Barrett

## Week: 8

## Learning Activities & Resources:
- Watched a video to refresh again on [how to create individual branches from VSCode.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?)
- Created a branch of the 'Learning Activities & Resources' part of this weeks learning journal in order to create a pull request and merge it at the end.
- Watched a video on naming conventions for [feature branches and pull requests for team development.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0w4oL4bJo8).
- I merged the pull request on Github and left the branch there. As mentioned in the first video link, theoretically completed feature branches can be kept for a few weeks to make sure they are no longer needed, after that they can be deleted after a discussion with the project team, or when deemed appropriate by the project manager.
- Watched a video on how to restore a WordPress site from [backup into a WAMP server](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-32abtu4ZwM).  

## Estimated Hours: 3

## Learning Experiment 
- This week I will experiment on my learning by using the [Pomodoro technique](https://www.todoist.com/productivity-methods/pomodoro-technique)
- I will be using my iPhone timer for the increments.

**Hypothesis:** _"I can accomplish more work in a shorter amount of time by using the Pomodoro technique."_    
- First 25mins: I further studied version control watching videos on how to create individual branches from VSCode.
- Second 25mins: I then looked into pull requests and how to merge these branches into the master branch.
- Third 25mins: I now created a feature branch for the Learning Activities & Resources part of this weeks learning journal to test what I have learned
- Fourth 25mins: I watched videos on how to backup a WordPress site [into a WAMP server](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-32abtu4ZwM). This was a refresh.
  
**Results:**  
- After analising my productivity for the first hour of this weeks work I believe I have accomplished more in a shorter period of time.
- I can confirm my hypothesis is correct and the work experiment has been a success.
  
**Conclusion:**  
- Looking back over this work experimet I believe the Pomodoro technique does effectively enhance productivity by
breaking down complex tasks into smaller pieces and increasing concentration and focus by incorporating 5minute breaks every 25mins with
the 4th break being 15-30minutes. I often spend alot of hours working on a subject that is made up of times that could be procrastination, or 
distraction due to not enough breaks. Splitting up the work with these 5 minute breaks and dedicating yourself to 25minutes of productivity is 
very effective at increasing the amount of work you can do in a shorter period of time.  

## Content Insights:
- The Pomodoro technique is an effective way to increase productivity while working.
- Using clear and appropriate naming strategies when creating feature branches is important for clarity when working on a coding project with a team.
- Completed feature branches can be kept for a few weeks to make sure they are no longer needed. After that they can be deleted after a discussion with the project team, or when deemed appropriate by the project manager.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
- People with methods and strategies to increase productivity and manage their time are very popular with employers. This is because unproductive 
employees [cost employers](https://firstup.io/blog/employee-productivity-statistics/) up to $605 billion per year.
- Being fluent with Git version control is a very important skill to have [for any software development job](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/version-control/version-control-best-practices/).
